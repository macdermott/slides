				<h2>The Design System Component Library Technical Overview</h2>
				<small>AKA why do the devs keep talking about npm</small>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>A design system really shines when you can take the designs and turning them into components</p>
				<p>Many design systems use React. But why? And what is React anyway?</p>

					<h2>What is React?</h2>
					<p>React is an open source JavaScript framework used specifically to allow front-end developers to
						create reusable components.</p>
					<p>Created by Facebook in 2013, it has gained popularity in recent
						years and is the underlying technology running the front end of Facebook, Instagram, Netflix and
						many other heavily used websites</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Why use React for the design library?</h2>
					<small>React is a perfect fit for a design library - Each component created in a design system will
						map
						to a React component</small>

					<h2>Why do people keep talking about "npm" and "packages"?</h2>
				</section>
				<section id="fragments">
					<p>
						The React components all live together in one Github repository (I'll talk about Github later)
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						To be able to reuse these components elsewhere, we need to bundle them up into a package (or
						library). The most popular tool to do this is a JavaScript package manager called
						<strong>npm</strong>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="fragments">
					<p>Developers can use npm to do a number of things, including</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">packaging</li>
						<li class="fragment">testing</li>
						<li class="fragment">linting (checking the code for errors and make sure it looks looks nice)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<small>npm is also used to keep track of dependencies. For example, this is how we tell
						the component library that we want to use React. Details of these dependencies are stored in
						package.json</small>

					<p>We can also use npm to create a reusable <strong>npm package</strong>. This will take

					<h2>So where does Github come into all of this?</h2>

					<small>When someone makes a change to the React components, Github Actions springs into

					<h2>Using a React component library</h2>

					<p>When you visit the previous page, the server translates each React component into the related

					<h2>Headless vs Static site</h2>
					<p>There are two ways to use React with a CMS</p>

						data to build

					<p class="fragment">Static uses the React components and CMS content to build a static HTML site</p>

					<img src="assets/images/Headless.png" />
